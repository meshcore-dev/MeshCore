# Meshcore payloads
Inside of each [meshcore packet](./packet_structure.md) is a payload, identified by the payload type in the packet header. The types of payloads are:

* Node advertisement.
* Acknowledgment.
* Returned path.
* Request (destination/source hashes + MAC).
* Response to REQ or ANON_REQ.
* Plain text message.
* Anonymous request.
* Group text message (unverified).
* Group datagram (unverified).
* Multi-part packet
* Custom packet (raw bytes, custom encryption).

This document defines the structure of each of these payload types.

NOTE: all 16 and 32-bit integer fields are Little Endian.

## Important concepts:

* Node hash: the first byte of the node's public key

# Node advertisement
This kind of payload notifies receivers that a node exists, and gives information about the node

# Acknowledgement

An acknowledgement that a message was received. Note that for returned path messages, an acknowledgement will be sent in the "extra" payload (see [Returned Path](#returned-path)) and not as a discrete ackowledgement. CLI commands do not require an acknowledgement, neither discrete nor extra.

# Returned path, request, response, and plain text message

Returned path, request, response, and plain text messages are all formatted in the same way. See the subsection for more details about the ciphertext's associated plaintext representation.

| Field            | Size (bytes)    | Description                                          |

## Returned path

Returned path messages provide a description of the route a packet took from the original author. Receivers will send returned path messages to the author of the original message.

# Group text message / datagram

| Field        | Size (bytes)    | Description                                |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|

| ciphertext   | rest of payload | encrypted message, see below for details   |

The plaintext contained in the ciphertext matches the format described in [plain text message](#plain-text-message). Specifically, it consists of a four byte timestamp, a flags byte, and the message. The flags byte will generally be `0x00` because it is a "plain text message". The message will be of the form `<sender name>: <message body>` (eg., `user123: I'm on my way`).
